# 🚗 Car Rental System

A dynamic car rental web application built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. This app allows users to browse available cars, book them for specific dates, and manage their bookings.

- **Responsive UI**: Fully responsive layout with Tailwind CSS.
- **Real-time Bookings**: Add, update, or cancel bookings in real time.
- **Car Search & Filter**: Search for cars by name, type, or availability.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
