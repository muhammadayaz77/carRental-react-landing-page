# 🚗 Car Rental System

A dynamic car rental web application built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. This app allows users to browse available cars, book them for specific dates, and manage their bookings. The project uses **React Router** for dynamic routing to create a seamless user experience as users navigate between pages.

## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic Routing**: Navigate easily between car listings, booking details, and user profiles using React Router.
- **Responsive UI**: Fully responsive layout with Tailwind CSS.
- **Real-time Bookings**: Add, update, or cancel bookings in real time.
- **Car Search & Filter**: Search for cars by name, type, or availability.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React**: For creating the user interface and dynamic rendering.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For fast and customizable styling.
- **React Router**: For dynamic, client-side routing.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The language powering the application.
